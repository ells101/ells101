## A little about me:

Sitting on my Dad's lap as he played  Diablo 2, I was transfixed less by the monsters, but how the PC was able to conjure scenes seemingly from thin-air. Experimenting with games as a child, I knew I wanted to find out more! I completed a computer science A-Level which led me to study philosophy at university. There I was taught predicate logic as part of my degree, opening my eyes to computational logic. Leaving university, pursuing a music career became my obsession until I scratched my programming itch with an online 2D game dev course. I reached out to a programmer friend and for the next 3 months he trained me on Python and Ruby. Realising that I learnt best through coaching, I enrolled with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to develop skills to be a **Full Stack Developer**. I've now accepted an apprenticeship to become a **Java SDET** at [Sparta Global](https://spartaglobal.com/) to upskill into **Java** and **Automated Testing**. It’s been an exciting career change, so with experience in events management, photo-shoot production and a decade of working in music, I can’t wait to bring my enthusiasm to my next job.
